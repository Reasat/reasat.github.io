== Summary
Applied ML engineer with 8+ years of experience building and deploying production ML systems across computer vision, NLP, and speech recognition. I specialize in end-to-end ML pipelines—from data curation and model training to evaluation, deployment, and monitoring—primarily on AWS.

== Selected impact
- Built a human-in-the-loop fax document processing system on AWS; reduced manual processing time by 80--90% and supported 300--475 faxes/day.
- Built an LLM-based system to extract structured data from insurance denial documents; enabled recovery of ~$3M/year in lost claims.
- Built an ontology-aware gene prioritization model (XGBoost) and deployed it to EC2; reduced manual variant analysis workload by 50%.
- Led open-source research initiatives via Kaggle competitions (Bengali.AI), including Kaggle grants totaling $200k.

== Experience
=== Ambry Genetics (AI Engineer, Remote) — 2025–Present
Built AI-driven solutions to enhance operational efficiency and extract insights from biomedical and business data.
- Human-in-the-loop Document AI (Fax)
-- Built a human-in-the-loop fax document processing system to automate document splitting, classification, and patient-to-order matching; reduced manual processing time by 80--90% and supported 300--475 faxes/day.
-- Designed Temporal workflow logic (state machine, routing, retries/fallbacks, and human review paths) and implemented Temporal worker services (background processes) for orchestration and AI inference.
-- Implemented OCR and LLM pipelines using AWS Textract and AWS Bedrock; persisted document metadata and workflow state in Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.
-- Built reviewer-facing UIs and a Streamlit dashboard for throughput and model performance reporting on an internal test dataset.
- Insurance Denial Extraction
-- Designed and implemented an LLM-based system to extract structured data from insurance denial documents, enabling recovery of approximately $3M annually in lost claims.
- Clinical Genomics ML
-- Developed ontology-aware features for a graph data structure and built an XGBoost model to prioritize genes; deployed to an EC2 instance and reduced manual variant analysis workload by 50%.
-- Built an LLM-based pedigree image classifier on AWS Bedrock, achieving 99% accuracy on an internal test dataset.

=== Bengali.AI (Co-founder) — 2017–Present
Bengali.AI builds open-source resources—datasets, libraries, and models—for ASR, CV, and NLP, released through Kaggle competitions to democratize AI. \[[https://www.bengali.ai/projects Full project list]]
