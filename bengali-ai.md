Bengali.AI builds open-source resources—datasets, libraries, and models—for automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP) in Bengali. These resources are publicly released through Kaggle competitions to democratize AI and advance research in Bengali language technologies.
