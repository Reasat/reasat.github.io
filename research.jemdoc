== Projects \& Research

This page highlights a few representative projects spanning production ML systems, Document AI, open-source benchmarks, and biomedical ML.

== Production ML systems (AWS)
=== Document AI: Fax processing (Ambry Genetics)
- Built a Temporal-orchestrated, human-in-the-loop fax document processing system on AWS to automate splitting, classification, and patient-to-order matching; reduced manual processing time by 80--90% and supported 300--475 faxes/day.
- Implemented Temporal worker services (background processes): heavier workers for OCR/LLM inference and lighter workers for orchestration and workflow bookkeeping.
- OCR + extraction with AWS Textract + AWS Bedrock; workflow state persisted in Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.

=== Document AI: Insurance denial extraction (Ambry Genetics)
- Designed an LLM-based system to extract structured fields from insurance denial documents, enabling potential recovery of ~$3M/year in lost claims.

=== Clinical genomics ML (Ambry Genetics)
- Built ontology-aware features and trained an XGBoost model to prioritize genes; deployed to EC2 and reduced manual variant analysis workload by 50%.
- Built an LLM-based pedigree image classifier on AWS Bedrock; 99% accuracy on an internal test dataset.

== Open-source datasets \& benchmarks (Bengali.AI)
\[[https://www.bengali.ai/projects Full project list]]

=== OOD Speech (ASR)
- First Bengali out-of-distribution speech recognition benchmark: 1100+ hours from 22,000+ contributors across 17 domains; fine-tuned GPT-based Whisper for regional Bengali ASR.

=== Document layout analysis (DocAI)
- BaDLAD: 33,695 annotated Bengali document samples across six domains; trained Mask R-CNN and YOLO-based object detectors for layout analysis.

=== Text normalization \& parsing
- Abugida Unicode normalizer/parser libraries supporting 7 Indic languages; improved LLM robustness under adversarial conditions by 5--10 points across multiple metrics.

== Biomedical ML (Vanderbilt University)
=== Data-efficient self-supervised learning (Histopathology)
- Built an active learning-based training pipeline for SimCLR; reduced labeled data requirements by 93% and training time by 62%.
\[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827024000537 paper]] \[[https://github.com/Reasat/data_efficient_cl github]]

=== MRI segmentation (Soft tissue tumors)
- Curated a musculoskeletal soft tissue tumor segmentation dataset (199 patients) and built multimodal UNet + SAM models; achieved Dice 80% (SOTA).
